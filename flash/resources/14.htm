      Hi Joe, thanks for a fantastic 2.5 years of working alongside you in the OCP VP off ice!<br />
<br />
<br />
I have so many fun, fond memories and enjoyed lots of laughs with the team! I also learnt so much from you and it was so great to see the transformation of OCP under your leadership.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wishing you all the very best for the next and very exciting new experience in your life which is about to commence.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the best, - Natalie Zarka<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Joe<br />
<br />
<br />
Wishing you all the very best for your retirement and next phase in life. It was great to work with you and the UK OCP Team, sharing with us all your deep experience in how to navigate Microsoft!<br />
<br />
<br />
Big thanks for your commitment to the career development of others through great coaching and care.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best wishes - Caroline Bryan<br />
<br />
<br />
In my moments of &lsquo;can I ever see the wood from the trees&rsquo;, I had my first 1:1 with Joe and this was to focus on my preparation for something called &lsquo;MYR&rsquo; which I discovered to be Mid Year Review. Joe was an inspiration with his patience and teaching, which I remember to this day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe, Thank you for all your help over the last 3 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s been great working with you, we had a good partnership and I&rsquo;ve learnt loads from you. I honestly could not have done this SMC lead job without you. You&rsquo;ve led this business with great integrity and accountability.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wish you all the best for the retirement. I promise I&rsquo;ll only call you occasionally for advice (probably weekly!).<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy the time off, it&rsquo;s well earned! - Rich ellis<br />
<br />
<br />
Remembering meeting you in a meeting room at 7am in the US years ago discussing. PS, and not knowing we would be working together in the future! Wishing you all the best Joe!<br />
<br />

I was a younger female in the tech industry trying to find my way and establish myself in Microsoft and Joe was extremely supportive. He focused back on the basics (it was probably 3 things!) and helped me gain confidence with what to me at the time was a big deal, a big meeting to prepare for and a process that was pretty intimidating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you Joe for my kick start in working for Microsoft.<br />
<br />
<br />
20+ years later it&rsquo;s been a pleasure to work with you again, working in an area you remain passionate about. I wish you all the happiness in the world in what&rsquo;s next for you and feel sure we will continue to partner with our partners.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bon Voyage x - Clare Barclay<br />

My fondest memory Joe was many years ago when I was earlier in career and had just joined Microsoft. This was Sept 1998. At the time Joe you were running our Small Business Division working for Chris Lewis.<br />
<br />
<br />
I joined Microsoft working for one of Joe&rsquo;s peers (David Burrows) and although I had a lot of experience working with Microsoft from a partner perspective, I found Microsoft overwhelming in my first couple of months.<br />
<br />
