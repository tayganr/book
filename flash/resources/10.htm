      Dearest Joe, Many congratulations on your retirement. It goes without saying that you will be sorely missed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many will I&rsquo;m sure, talk about the incredible business impact you&rsquo;ve driven over the years, but for me and in the small amount of time I&rsquo;ve known you (in the context of your career), it&rsquo;s been your genuine kindness, authenticity and candour that have stood out. You will be missed because of who you are and how you modelled the very best values, with humility.<br />
<br />
<br />
A great leader who&rsquo;s done amazing things across so many roles and countries, who has touched many lives &ndash; what an amazing legacy!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for everything you&rsquo;ve done for Microsoft, the team, and personally for me!<br />
<br />
<br />
Congratulations, here&rsquo;s wishing you every success in your<br />
<br />
<br />
personal life and into the future! - Paul Lee<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey Joe,<br />
<br />
<br />
I can help but feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to work closely with you. It&rsquo;s inspiring to see your values in action, caring for the business but above all for the people - and always keeping a good sense of humour (I still laugh of the Italian black mistress story!).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for everything during the past year. I hope you enjoy your next stage and we can keep in touch!<br />
<br />
<br />
- Mariana Azevedo<br />

<br />
Dear Joe<br />
<br />
<br />
Heres to the memories of our &amp;#39;Dream Team&amp;#39;. Thank you for all your support, guidance and partnership - it was certainly a fun few years! Hope you enjoy the next chapter of your career.<br />
<br />
<br />
All Our Love x - Lisa, Natalie and Sam<br />
<br />
<br />
Its been quite a Journey working with Joe for the last 3 years I was in hospital when the journey started and despite Joe pushing back I insisted on speaking to him to discuss my return to work, Joe spoke to me but instead of talking about my return he focused the discussion on my recovery. His care for people and his integrity is unquestionable and often immoveable.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have gone through well prepared QBC&rsquo;s and not so well prepared QBC&rsquo;s but Joes ability to simplify a message and deliver clarity has been tremendous. We have toured the meeting rooms of country houses throughout the south of England and have had some amazing meetings and even better dinners (not in all cases).<br />
<br />
<br />
We have agreed and disagreed on the philosophy of partnering but we have always got to consensus in the end. It has been a privilege to work with him during these transformational times.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have learned a lot from Joe and the fact he did 3 years in role did not surprise me, I would like to thank Joe for everything he has done for the team and I his commitment and passion to leave Commercial Partner in a great place has happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know Joe will not be taking up golf as I expect to see him in and around the partner world in some capacity or other for at least the next 20 years!<br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck Joe 24 years at Microsoft is something to behold &ndash; I think you deserve a break from QBC&rsquo;s, Vegas trips and the weekly commute.<br />
<br />
<br />
