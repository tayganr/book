      Thanks for all your support and guidance over the last few years Joe. I&rsquo;ve learnt a ton from you (clearly simplifying to 3 things!) and will always appreciate the feedback and wisdom that you&rsquo;ve shared.<br />
<br />
<br />
When trying to think about a message for you I reflected on all the amazing places we got to stay in for our LT offsites, you at Cliveden sharing a room with Christine Keeler, the dining room stories at Pennyhill park, and also Coworth park when I managed to lead you on a merry dance around the whole grounds and get us all stuck in a torrential downpour. Luckily I caught it on camera. I don&rsquo;t think I recovered laughing at your disgust in being stuck out in the middle of nowhere, wet through, for a good few hours!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and how upset you got at Mafia when we kept picking you to be killed. Thanks for all the fun and laughs we had as a group, and as you go and enjoy your retirement from Microsoft, just think you won&rsquo;t have to ever, ever again have a discussion about ISV numbers or true ACR!<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy the new opportunities that exist outside of Microsoft and it&rsquo;s such a shame that we didn&rsquo;t get to see you in person to give you a proper send off. Hopefully we will get you back and be able to do it properly at some future time. I&rsquo;m sure you will do, but I hope when you look back at your 24 years at Microsoft that you reflect with pride the impact you have had on so many people and so many businesses, in lots of different countries. I am sure there were more fascinating stories I didn&rsquo;t get to hear but hope too at some point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wishing you, and your family, the best of health and happiness for the future. Keep in touch.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Andrew Joe<br />

Thank you so much for all your support and guidance to both myself and the ECM team and your leadership of OCP. Wishing you all very the best for the future - it sounds like you have plenty to keep you busy. And if you ever need a quiz show host, you know where to come!<br />
<br />
<br />
All the best, - Katie<br />

Hi Joe - As you fif inally leave Microsoft for the next chapter of your life/career&hellip; I wanted to share a very brief message of thanks and good luck&hellip;.<br />
<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s been an absolute pleasure working for you and being part of the ELT over the last few years - I&rsquo;ve enjoyed being part of your team more than any other period of my tenure at Microsoft, so thank you for the faith you&rsquo;ve shown in me and for your leadership and direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you &amp;#38; Good luck! - Danny Ovens As Joe does everything in 3:<br />
<br />
<br />
THANK YOU for your contribution to the A14 community and especially to the EMEA 6. You have inspired us all and pushed us to do the best possible work impacting partners and customers.<br />
<br />
<br />
THANK YOU for your English/Irish/Australian sense of humor. Pretty Commonwealth!<br />
<br />
<br />
THANK YOU for our personal connection based on respect, trust and accountability. I have learned a lot from you.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Wim Delbeke<br />
