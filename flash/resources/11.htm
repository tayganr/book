      I recall the time at the OCP Christmas Party at The Grove where you realised that I had forgotten my shoes because I was so much shorter than usual!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your support over the last 3yrs. It has been great working with you. All the best for your retirement which I am sure will be another adventure!<br />
<br />
<br />
- Claire C<br />
<br />
<br />
A difficult message to write, as I would have loved the opportunity to work for you longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of the OCP LT. Your passion, dedication and energy for the business and people is inspirational.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have learned a huge amount from you and the team you have built, and it has been a true privilege to be a part of&hellip; I will certainly always remember to summarise in 3&amp;#39;s!<br />
<br />
<br />
You supported me in a key milestone and achievement in my career, which I will always be extremely thankful and grateful for. It is not easy to find people who will coach, support and help you in your journey and you have done all three for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe, One of my favourite memories since joining your team was of our f ififirst LT offsite at Coworth park and our evening playing Maf f ifia as a team.... it was so harsh that you were regularly voted off! However as a leader with Italian heritage it&rsquo;s probably not so surprising! I&rsquo;d like to say you took it with grace but the way you said &ldquo;I forgive but I never forget&rdquo; left a different impression.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy your retirement Joe, you&rsquo;ve earnt it. - Angela<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Joe<br />
<br />
<br />
As you go into the next chapter of your life. May you enjoy the very best life has to offer. Enjoy unlimited week-ends and holidays with your loved ones. And let the relaxation begin&hellip;<br />
<br />
<br />
Wishing you a wonderful retirement. - Marie Carre-ly<br />

<br />
Dear Joe.<br />
<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ve always loved this picture. It was at the end of my first year in OCP and you have the entire team around you as you celebrate their success.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last few years have been tremendously exciting (certainly worthy of a Vegas celebration!) and I&rsquo;ve developed massively under your leadership. I&rsquo;ll never forget our first few meetings which consisted of me interviewing for the tech lead role. The first was in TVP and I recall the passion you had for the role, I always remember being questioned on compliance (a first for me in an interview process) but it told me a lot about your character and integrity. The second interview was in a buffet queue in Vegas.<br />
<br />
<br />
The first two encounters couldn&rsquo;t be more different but what was palpable was the excitement and the journey we were on to create something special in the people the organisation and the economy. I&rsquo;ve grown as a leader under your stewardship and I&rsquo;d like to thank you for everything you have done for me personally and the unbelievable contribution you have made to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS Only a global pandemic was going to stop us having one final hug - Mark Margolis<br />
<br />
<br />
I wish you and your family the very best in your next adventure&hellip;I am sure you will be able to enjoy a few more road trips in the cars<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope we have the opportunity to cross paths again, at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck and thanks again&hellip;.enjoy! - Carly<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi Joe, Thanks for the investment of time, and the support &amp;#38; coaching over the last few years. It&rsquo;s been great working with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the best for your next steps. Thanks &amp;#38; Regards<br />
<br />
<br />
