      Joe, this is a massive personal thank you for the impact you have had in my career and life. You took a leap of faith and hired me into this great company. Frankly I was far from the f inished product and let&rsquo;s just say I had a few rough edges. The IT industry was a very different place to what it is now with a work hard, play hard culture. This is the team of people you had to lead, motivate and control all at the same time<br />
<br />
<br />
And we didn&rsquo;t know it at the time but what a masterful job you did. We were young and a bit mad but you always had that bit of class to know when to lean in with a coaching hand and the bit of feedback that was needed. And it was always &ldquo;3 things&rdquo;... I have more friendships from that short period in my MSFT career than any other stage put together and that is because of the great team you built.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every time you have had a connection with me has been a time of acceleration for my career. Your coaching as the EMEA VP for PS both in my LT-1 roles and then supporting me for the role of UK PS lead meant so much. Our interaction and your support in my role helped with my growth as a leader in so many ways &ndash; the domain knowledge and my leadership development. Our 1:1s became a trusted and safe space where I could be my authentic self.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the time I have loved the most has been this time on the UK SLT together. The trusted safe space has continued and the next time I&rsquo;m in the T5 lounge on a Thursday evening and you&rsquo;re not there for a good gossip (sorry I mean strategic business review clearly...) will be a strange one.<br />
<br />
<br />
So that&rsquo;s my way of saying I&rsquo;m going to miss you. When you were buffif ifing off some of those rough edges 18/19 years ago there&rsquo;s a phrase I never thought I would say. But put simply Joe you have had the most impact on my career of anyone I have worked with. You hired me, promoted me, were the challenging boss I needed at the right time, you have coached me, help me get promoted again, and been a trusted coach and mentor. Most importantly you have been a friend and that doesn&rsquo;t change after June.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy your non-retirement retirement Joe.<br />
<br />
<br />
It feels like the start of a new chapter more than the end of something. - Derrick McCourt<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe, It has been absolutely wonderful working with you! I&rsquo;ve learned so much over the years and truly valued the coaching and partnership from my initial move from California working for you in Public Sector to EMEA Education and recently on my decision to move to Digital Sales.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wishing you the very best with this next step and I&rsquo;m<br />
<br />
<br />
always available for a lunch catch up! - Regina Murray<br />
<br />
