<br />
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and JPC Celebration of Microsoft&rsquo;s 20th year in Ireland 2006<br />
<br />
<br />
Chapter 2: 2000 - 2006 GM Ireland<br />
<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ve known Joe for over 20 years &ndash; we first met when I was the Sales Director in Compaq Ireland and was delighted when Joe offered me an opportunity to join Microsoft in Ireland in 2002. Joe was a terrific mentor and leader and provided me with so many fantastic opportunities to grow in my career and my personal development and I want to truly thank him for that support. If I had to recall a few key moments then of course there would have to be 3 things;<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Joe&rsquo;s Values &ndash; a man of great integrity you can trust and rely on 2. Joe&rsquo;s love of Cars &ndash; I&rsquo;ll never forget a trip through the newly opened port tunnel with the windows down listening to the roar of the new Jag!<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Joe&rsquo;s drive, innovation and creativity &ndash; a great example was in 2005 when Joe lead the creation of a National Productivity Centre in Ireland backed by the Irish Government and the Irish Management Institute to help drive the productivity discussion and the potential for technology at the highest levels It has been my pleasure to know Joe as a manager a mentor and as a friend and I wish him every success in his 3rd Act! - Paul Mason<br />
<br />
<br />
Whilst successfully running the SMB business he was<br />
<br />
<br />
secretly hatching a plan to separate out the Irish business. Having married Niav, a lovely Irish Lady, they were keen to move to Ireland to raise their family.<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe was the driving force in making the Irish office a<br />
<br />
<br />
subsidiary, the team joked it only took Joe a year to break away from the UK yet it took the country 800 years!<br />
<br />
<br />
It was here he hired his long standing friend Derrick McCourt and the obsession with the number 3 began.<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe is an outstanding leader &ndash; with passion, drive, hearth and temper! I truly enjoyed working with Joe. Even though it is more than 15 years ago we worked together I miss your sharp insights, great ideas and personal warmth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Be very proud of what you have accomplished. We are many that will always remember you &ndash; and enjoy your new journey.<br />
<br />
<br />
