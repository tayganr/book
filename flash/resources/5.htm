      Chapter 3: 2007 - 2011 M&amp;#38;O Lead, Western Europe<br />
<br />
<br />
The air miles start clocking up - whilst keeping the family home in Ireland Joe starts his regular commute across Europe and launches the<br />
<br />
<br />
commercial cloud business ensuring the European data center was located in Dublin! He also launched Windows Vista - remember that?!?!?<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Joe<br />
<br />
<br />
I will never forget meeting you for the first time, in that dinky little hotel on the outskirts of Milan for our in-person interview. That day really changed my life. First of all, you took a big chance on me, hiring me as the Windows BG Lead for WE, when I didn&amp;#39;t even know what an OEM was at the time. HA! And secondly, you gave me and my family the opportunity to live in Italy, which completely changed my entire family&amp;#39;s next five years and really my kids&amp;#39; entire outlook on life. I have never loved any job I&amp;#39;ve had in my 25 year career more than that job, and I learned so much from you! I am grateful that you took a leap of faith in me and that you gave me the guidance I needed to become great at my job! I was also so impressed with you, because you also took feedback from your team and actually used it to become better. Not many people actually can change, but you did. And I&amp;#39;ve always remembered that as a special quality about you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Should I also mention the smell of the Paris La Defense office after a week of prep for Mid-Year Review? Or the many hours spent in Amsterdam HQ on the top floor scrubbing our scorecard while eating Havarti cheese? Or the Area of the Year trophy? The LT offsite where we were four-wheeling in Austria? The sailing race in Portugal that you HAD to win? Fun? Who needs fun when you can win instead? I hope that your retirement brings you more time on the road (not on a plane, but in a fancy car???) and that you can enjoy your family! You will always be a special person to me! Thank you for everything and best of luck in your next phase of life.<br />
<br />

Biking down memory lane with the Sweden Office 365 Team : Thank You Joe for the inspiring leadership, outstanding teamwork, and world-class collaboration within the WE Leadership Team during those crucial cloud transformation years 2010-2014! With my best wishes for the future to you and family, Per-Olof<br />
