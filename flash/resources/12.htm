      Joe,<br />
<br />
<br />
You played a huge role in how I feel to work at Microsoft, and also in motivating a new mum&rsquo;s return to work, to a new role as well. Sure you were the reason I calmed my imposter syndrome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please never under estimate the inflf lflfluence you had on my career at a critical point in my life. Your integrity and fairness I value hugely then, now and I am sure in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
I look forward to lunch in Ireland with you! You will be very much missed but I look forward to hear what exciting things you get up to in your retirement!<br />
<br />
<br />
The THREE things &hellip; never lose the power of three. Best wishes<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Hi Joe, best of luck with your well earned retirement, although I don&rsquo;t think I am under any illusions, I imagine you will be keeping yourself just as busy in the new challenges that lay ahead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our first meeting was many years earlier, when I was the Home Office Account Exec and you agreed to be the Exec Sponsor to their new COO. Looking back, I remember thinking that you were quite a formidable executive, and in some ways outranking the contact at that time, but you were able to bring the gravitas we needed to the account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fast forward 5 years, and you were a formidable hiring manager too when I was looking for my first LT role (so formidable in fact you didn&rsquo;t give me the first job I went for and made me wait another 6 months!).<br />
<br />
<br />
One reason I was so committed to joining OCP was I knew how much I would learn from you as a Microsoft Leader. The bit I didn&rsquo;t realise was how much I would learn from you was on a personal level too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe has his game face, but the bit I like most about Joe is when the game face comes down, and the real Joe comes out. You care deeply about people, it really is at your core, and this is why I have continued to enjoy working for you through the last few years, due to the trust that created.<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe you will be sorely missed, and none of us will ever be able to think of things in anything but 3&rsquo;s, but your impact will be seen for many years to come.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the best, - Simon<br />
<br />
<br />
Joe - I have learnt so much from you in your 3 years. From the simplicity of keeping things to three, to the huge impact you have made on the culture of OCP and so your impact goes far beyond ACR, ACA and partner association!<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy your retirement. - Paula Costa<br />
<br />
<br />
Dear Joe,<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess you won&rsquo;t be surprised that your reputation travels far. This is for a good reason. So many people told me before I relocated to the UK that you are a tough leader to work with but I can learn a lot if I&rsquo;m present.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for pulling me into the heart of the discussions and creating space for me within your organization.<br />
<br />
<br />
I learned many things (on top of the rule of three) like &ldquo;lets flip this thing on it&rsquo;s head&rdquo; or business courage &ldquo;shape the business your way even of world guide you differently&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last thanks is for being a good person caring for me my family when we moved in and when lockdown took place.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know your endless energy and passion for changing things will guide you to your next adventure, I wish you all the best in this new chapter you are writing.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Liron Rozen<br />
