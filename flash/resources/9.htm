      I had the pleasure of working with Joe as OCP was formed and we were working to bring it to life. Joe was a hugely enthusiastic leader of the team, a great supporter for me personally, we also managed to grab the odd drink and geek out as fellow petrolheads.<br />
<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s been an absolute delight to work with you Joe. The bottom line is how you make people feel and it&rsquo;s always been an &lsquo;easy joy!&rsquo;<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy what will be a wonderful next phase and keep looking forward!<br />
<br />
<br />
Take care and do stay in touch. - Fiona Cullen<br />
<br />
<br />
I learned a lot from Joe and his experience in terms of how the all up business runs, I hope he picked up some useful learnings from me too!<br />
<br />
<br />
What a career, huge congratulations, enjoy your retirement (I use retirement in the loosest sense as I suspect there is more to come!) and remember cars or watches both classify as sensible investments<br />
<br />
<br />

Dear Joe, What an incredible journey and what an amazing ride! I am sure incredible things will come next, and I look forward to hearing about all your new adventures.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hoping that you, and your family, will adjust to living together in one location after all these years &ndash; that in itself is a huge change, but I am sure a welcome one too!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for all the great partnership throughout the years, and here&rsquo;s to celebrating all you&rsquo;ve achieved at Microsoft and all that&rsquo;s still to come!<br />
<br />
<br />
Wishing you all the very best, With love &amp;#38; hugs xx<br />
<br />
<br />
- Andrea<br />

Joe you joined the UK business at a key time for myself personally, when I was shifting from being a &lsquo;back offififififif ififice&rsquo; sales excellence lead to a &lsquo;front offififififif ififice&rsquo; partner sales director. Your belief and steerage during this early period really enabled &amp;#38; installed confidence, to aid me step forward and lead Surface &amp;#38; Modern Work!<br />
<br />
<br />
Always valued your insight, counsel and honesty. Thank you and wish you all the best for the future!<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank You - Howard<br />
